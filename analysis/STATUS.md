# BRIEF-4 results

Stage 1 accepted on `fix/slowdowns` in both repositories. Production Release,
debug tools off, fullscreen 7680x4320 at 60 Hz, default Ultra, recorded route,
slot 2. Completion clock throughout; measurements start at route frame 900.

Storage-reuse experiment: 59.940 Hz, zero gaps >25 ms, 21.836 ms maximum,
45.6% p99 busy. This isolated experiment fell to 4x under the old presenter
accounting. With corrected accounting, both later runs stay at 17x..18x.
Patch and receipts remain local under `analysis/brief4/local/dyn-storage*`.

Receipts: local `analysis/brief4/local/baseline/*-native-summary.json`, matching
CSV/stdout and load receipt. Native overlay calls positive, interpreted calls zero.
`state-proof.json` proves the master-compatible private slot and prescribed
`production-counter-saves` slot have identical bytes except header offsets 32..35;
the guest/device payload SHA-256 is
`fff644dbaf37984be1066170131c2d887f211af8220ac5b3cd50e7de8eefd1a4`.
Cap receipts: local `analysis/brief4/local/cap/{quiet,loaded}*`. Original saves and player settings remain untouched.

Accepted evidence: `coverage-production/quiet-summary.json` and
`drawable-events/loaded-summary.json` under local `analysis/brief4/local/`.
Rates round to 60.0 Hz; zero gaps over 25 ms, p99 busy below 60% in both.
The loaded case passed before the final production-only PGXP, coverage and
Windows timer fixes; only failing quiet was repeated, per the owner rule.
All runs have native overlay calls, zero interpreted/dirty execution and no
dispatch misses. Title ctest: 21/21 pass (`stage1-title-tests.txt`).
50 generated shards unchanged (`coverage-regen.txt`). The final binary uses the
prescribed production-counter save directly; `pgxp-production/state-proof.json`
confirms the same guest/device payload. Prior Windows/Mac component checks are
archived locally; no extra experiments were run after the minimum-testing note.
